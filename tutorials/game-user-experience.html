					Do you know that good or bad subliminal feeling by playing a game?
					Most people dont get so deep into gamedevelopment that they actually figure out what this really is about.
					For most hardcore gamers and devs they know what I am talking about here.
				</p>
				<p>
					In fact your game needs to have some gameplay that's fun, cool or extraordinary. But that's not all.
					If you make a game, it need to behave and feel like it should be. And there are tons of things that
					are related to this topic. This not only goes for indie games, AAA titles are also need UX.
					You can even point it down to an engine. Just for an example: take
					unity and unreal: the rendering of the unity engine gives a more grisp feel, as unreal a more soft one. Aren't it?
				</p>
				<p>
					This post isn't related to the engine you pick or neither one is better then the other.
					It is about the descissions you make by developing; designing your game.
				</p>
				<p>
					If I would like to make Minions within a dungeon working and then get live. It already would be live.
					But I am really concerned and focused on giving a great experience by playing this game.
					Every sound is picked precisely because it matters. Every graphic has a look because of a meaning.
					The UI has a specific size, a look and different states because of a meaning.
				</p>
				<p>
					<img src="../assets/tutorials/gamedevelopment.jpg" alt="gamedevelopment">
					As just for example: A button on a mobile device should have around 40x40 pixels to be easily accessible.
					But on Desktop itr could be smaller if you are using a mouse, because your input device is more precise. But this also depends which input device you are using.
					What's with a controller? - There are no rules for every scenario so testing is up to you.
					Oh and testing yourself isn't the best way since you are focussing on these things.
					It would be better to test with some other persons, which don't know what you are looking for.
				</p>
				<p>
					When you start developing a game, you are always exited when a pixel moves. That's a feeling every
					gamedev experiences. But it's quite hard to take a step back and ask yourself: "If someone sees this the first time, would he get what it is supposed to be?".
					That's not a graphical thing, it's not about gestaltung. It's about the design (the meaning) behind.
					When talking about design it is not referrenced to color and form, it is referrenced to development.
					So: Every button was designed to be easily accessed, with a smooth animated state-change to notify the gamer about
					the current state-change. It even gets a color which symbols a more passive or active meaning.
				</p>
				<p>
					Talking about this may seem so basic, because it is learned from many games. but there are a lot mechanics
					in a game and asking yourself about the meaning, understandment and obvious interaction points helps to create
					a good User Experience.
				</p>
				<p>
					From my background: I studied communicational design and work as an UX designer. But you don't need to have studied. If you are a gamer,
					you already know the basics. You are the targetgroup by yourself. That is a good thing and a bad at once: since you are most likely too deep involved.
					Lean back in your seat and think about what you are missing in your favourite games. Think about what you are missing by controls, what would make your next game easier?
					That's were to start. You need distance to your own excitement and look at your game with the eyes of someone foreign.
				</p>
				<p>
					<img class="align-left" src="../assets/tutorials/ux-button.gif" alt="ux button in games"/>
					Let's dive into some example. For Minions within a Dungeon there were several iterations on improvements to get a better UX out of the game.
					To start we take the button example. It does not always need bright colors to notify the gamer about a state change.
					Scaling the size isn't subtle too. But in some cases it fits better.
					By scaling subtle you target a medium sized distraction. It depends how important the action is and how
					important you want it to be.
				</p>
				<p>
					Also the action is different depending on hovering - more subtle - or clicking (strong action).
					So you got a wiggle effect on clicking. There are a few reasons for that: first of all, the shaking animation
					is very "loudly" an symbolizes a strong or ending action. It also clearly visualises a state change.
					Another reason is: motion provides meaning.
					A hover state does have the same meaning, independently if it's a button, label or sprite.
					It just varied in how important an action is.
				</p>
				<p>I hope this little excursion gave you a bit insight in UX for game development and
					how minions within a dungeon is made. If you got feedback or questions just contact me via twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/sam_vieten">@sam_vieten</a>.
