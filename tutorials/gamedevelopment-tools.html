					<h1>Gamedevelopment tools Part 1</h1>
					<time datetimte="2016-09-27">18.10.2016</time>
				</header>
				<p>This post coveres recommendations on: graphics software, game frameworks (2D &amp; 3D) and small comandline tools.
					The prices are not fix. For pricing, visit the developers website and have a look on your own.</p>
				<p>
					This post will be interesting for beginners and those who want to discover some tools that will make live easier.
					Even if you are completely new to the field, you might end up asking: what
					is the fastes, best tool out there? So there is no answer to that "best" question. But I've got some
					tools that you really check out if you are in for gamedev, which will make your life easier.
				</p>
				<p>
					First off: For those of you who came from a design perspective: There will no Adobe in this post. Since I am
					really not liking it's software anymore due to bad optimized old code and overloaded functions that have
					bad user experience. I worked with Adobe CC fot a long time, but there was a point when I turned my back to it,
					since it made me so slow. As it is easier to develop new software nowadays, there is more software that better
					fits your pocket and the skillset.
				</p>

				<h3>Graphics: Affinity Designer (Win, Mac / Around 50$)</h3>
				<p>So this one is wow! For me as a Designer it is totally replaced photoshop and illustrator, and still
				benefits me in many ways; And &madash; the price is one time payment, yes! If you keep that in relation to an
				Adobe license: it costs less than 1/12 of the money. (considering a whole year - after 2 it would be 1/24 of the priece etc.)
				and affinity designer keeps better quality due to a newer code base and newer ideas behind it.</p>

				<p>In the latest version, Affinity Designer has improved so much that I don't miss a single function,
				that Adobe implemented in their products. It keeps a modern UI and keeps a very high performance. I even can edit quite large files with
				over thousand of layers on my 12" MacBook. That's incredible. It even got
				real time visuals on layer blending and stuff only by hovering a menu. You really get a full pack for your money and I highly recommend it.</p>

				<p>If you coming from an Adobe / Designer background: some tools are familiar. Some aren't - keep in mind this isn'<td>
					photoshop. The biggest struggle designers have is to learn a new graphics tool: by expecting everything works as in photoshop. Affinity Designer does some things different, better, cleaner. You have to learn it.
					If you are familiar with graphics software it might be easier to get into it. But as said: don't expect a photoshop experience. (In my opinion Affinity does most things better)
				</p>
				<p>Affinity Designer is available for: Windows and MacOS<br />

				<img style="float: left;" src="../assets/tutorials/aseprite-logo.png" alt="Aseprite Logo" width="100" height="100" />

				<h3>Graphics: Aseprite  (Win, Mac, Linux / Around 15$)</h3>
				<p>If you are in for pixelart: you should check out this little tool.
					It looks oldschool, and it is designed to be old school: limited in functionality and UI. But that's the point! It does it well:
					Aseprite only keeps what you really needs and so you learn to use it very fast and comfortable. The UI seems to be
					intended to give you that feeling when sitting in front of an oldschool OS. I kinda enhoyed it, working the first time with it.
				</p>

				<p>
					In my opinion pixelart is very hard, even harder than vector stuff. (Only my opinion),
					by using Aseprite I felt being capable of it - not that I am - haha. But it comforted me in a way that's very subliminal.
					The result of the work was always better than expected and I can not tell why. Maybe the tools are aligned very well.
					Working on pixel art felt so much easier than with bigger graphics tools.
				</p>
				<p>I checked out many tools for pixelart and it was the best for me. Since I don't like programs that are too huge
				and trying to fit everything. I don't want to learn for three weeks, I really appreciate the idea of a small,
				just for the case program. So you can sit down for one or two days and you get to learn everything.</p>
				<p>Aseprite keeps the focus on your work and gives you a minimal UI that fades in the background.
					For every pixelart fan out there: check it out.</p>
				<p>Aseprite is available for: Windows, MacOS and Linux<br />

				<p>In the next part I will talk about 2D &amp; a 3D frameworks, also on some comandline tools and js in general for gamedevelopment.
