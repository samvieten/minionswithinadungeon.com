					<h1>Gamedevelopment tools Part 2</h1>
					<time datetimte="2016-09-27">18.10.2016</time>
				</header>
				<p>As promised I will talk about game frameworks. The meaning of javascript and some comandline tools.
					If you got any questions don't hesistate to contact me via twitter: <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/sam_vieten">@sam_vieten</a>

				<h2>Game Frameworks</h2>
				<p>So, for those of you who are looking for framework to have more control about your game: you are living in a great time.
					There are hundreds of frameworks. HTML5 (JS) has been exploding and grows from day to day. As you may have noticed: I am note
					a fan of big software, which is overloaded with everything. So I've got two framework recommendations for you: One in written JS and one in Lua.
				</p>
				<p>The benefit of JS is that you can learn it very easily. The bad site: most of the newbies will write unclean Javascript code.
					But that's not a topic for this post. There will be some on Javascript for gamedevelopment later on.</p>

				<h3>2D Game Framework: PhaserJS (Free)</h3>
				<p>What makes this Framework the best (in my opinion) for gamedevelopment? First of all: It's Javascript, so: crossplatform.
					Now you are crying: But I want to run my game as an app! - And I say: That's not problem with JS.</p>
				<p>
					If you are coming from a webdesign or webdevelopment site of view: you have to throw a lot of knowledge of Javascript away.
					There are differeces in Javascript for web / gamedevelopment and even for HTML. You are now writing an application, no longer a website.
					Okay if you take it serious you are writing still anything you could do on a website. But you can transform it in a native app. No webapp,
					no half by half, you can turn it into a full app. -A solution for this goes down the text.
				</p>
				<p>
					PhaserJS really does a great job in supporting you with everything you will need to develop a 2D game. The development is still ongoing
					and there are nearly no bugs for a software from one developer. This is thanks to it's open source nature on github and support by the community.
					By talking about the community: that's another strong benefit on phaser: It's quite familiar and the community is big and helps a lot.
				</p>
				<p>
					So someone said phaserJS has an API that's a bit similiar to actionscript. I've never done flash. I started with pure javascript, so I can not vote on that.
					But what I can tell you is that it's API is really simple and easy to learn. It comes with different physics, data loading, particles, animations, tween, soundmanagement and much much more. It's packed
					with a ton of features. You can even write a plugin for it. There are some out: like an isometric one.
				</p>
				<p>
					I've never seen such an active project from a small studio or developers. You really should check it out.
				</p>
				<p>PhaserJS is available for any System with a Browser.<br />
				<a target="_blank" href="https://phaser.io/">phaser.io</a></p>

				<h3>2D Game Framework: Löve (Free)</h3>
				<p>
					If you are familiar with C++ or ES6 Javascript, Gamedevelopment or full time development, you might feel kind of "undertooled" with löve lua.
					But don't take it as a bad thing. I think Löve is a great framework for smaller or repeatable (random gen.) games. It has a clean syntax and comes
					around with everything you need for a 2D game. It's pure simpleness itself.
				</p>
				<p>You download an apk / app file and just drag &amp; drop your files in it and.. voila, you got a full app running. It's gorgerous for indie game starters
				and even if you want to explore a neat and practible language for games.</p>

				<p>Löve is available for: Windows, MacOS and Linux<br />
				<a target="_blank" href="https://love2d.org/">love2d.org</a></p>

				<h3>3D Game Framework: Babylon.js (Free)</h3>
				<p>It's creazy. This Javascript based 3D framework does have the performance to run 3D content at high framerates. It even comes packed
					with mirroring surfaces; A functionallity which big software like unity wasn't hardly capable of a few years ago.
					It even is a payed feature nowadays in most gamedevelopment software. In babylon you get it for free.
				</p>

				<p>
					The API is quite simple (for a 3D engine) and you will start very fast. It is packed with a whole lot of features and for smaller 3D games, you gonna go with it.
					I never build a big 3D game with it, so I am just talking of basic, small 3D projects. But I think if you are concious about javascript performance, you will be capable
					of some bigger ones.
				</p>
				<p>
					BabylonJS is one of the fastes 3D stuff on a js basis. And you will get impressed by the exaples of it's really broad capabilities and that by keeping it for free.
				</p>
				<p>BabylonJS is available for: Windows, MacOS and Linux<br />
				<a target="_blank" href="http://www.babylonjs.com/">babylonjs.com</a></p>

				<h3>Desktop Application Wrapper: NWJS.io (free)</h3>
				<p>Some of you may know electron by github- this is similiar but in my opinion much better: NWJS is an application wrapper for web content.
					You can write a web-application or site and pack it into a native app-wrapper. It even is capable to run Node Modules on the "clientsite".
					This gives you access to all the native joy: like filesystem, bluetooth, etc. etc. all what you know from the latest HTML5 2.0 features.
					It even runs merely the latest chromium, they are always keeping it up near the newest version.
				</p>
				<p>
					Something that nwjs does better than other competitor is, that you just download the app, but it in your gamedev folder. Then create an index.hmtl and a package json (config). done.
					You are just clicking on the nwjs symbol and it takes automatically the index.html and loads all the stuff. Other wrappers need more initialization and configuration.
					With nwjs it's dead simple and I prefer it over electron and cordova.
				</p>
				<p>NWJS is available for: Windows, MacOS and Linux<br />
				<a target="_blank" href="https://nwjs.io/">nwjs.io</a></p>


				<h3>Comandline: Spritesmith (Free)</h3>
				<p>There is spritesmith, an npm module which can pack your 2D graphics into spritesheets with a ton of options. There is also a grunt / gulp plugin, to integrate spritesmith within your taskrunner.</p>
				<p>It really helpes a lot. integrated into grunt it packs all spritesheets with optimizations which are easy to integrate into an nwjs app running phaserJS.
					So now doubt, if you are more the guy for a commandline - check it out.
				</p>
				<p>Spritesmith is available as a grunt and gulp task<br />

				<h4>Some words on development in js</h4>
				<p>So - I know - there is much about JS here. But it's a language which explodes and is capable of writing full applications if done right.
				There will be a post on performance on JS for gamedevelopment. And if you are familiar with it: NodeJS has great opportunities, even for gamedevelopment. If you take wrappers
				like nwjs, you get up to a whole new level. JS may seem strange for developers which come from a C background. But you really just have to know your tools.
				Javascript behaves differntly than other languages, but that's not all because of javascript itself, there are reasons for that, some good, some bad. But all in all it's a great easy language
				which runs nearly everywere. For those of you who want a more strict programming experience:
				have a look at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">typescript.</a></p>
				<p>I hope you liked this little overview &mdash; these are my favourite tools. Maybe you like some others more. But that's by opinion, I hope that I helped you to start into gamedevelopment.
				Or wrote about about something new for you. If you got any questions, just get in contact, via twitter: <a href="http://twitter.com/sam_vieten/">@sam_vieten</a>.</p>
